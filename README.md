The Healthcare Communication Platform aims to establish seamless communication between administrators, doctors, and patients within a healthcare organization. Through a web-based system, administrators can activate doctors, while patients can register and access medical services. Leveraging ReactJS for the frontend and utilizing API consumption with JWT token authentication, the project addresses challenges like secure admin authentication, role-based access control, and doctor activation. This ensures efficient workflows, enhanced data security, and effective communication among stakeholders.
